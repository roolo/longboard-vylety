(where I come, there i come)

- I am traveling some shorter trips (<20km), but I am trying to make it more and more
- when I'll get stronger, I would try some multi-day trips out of Prague
  - I have lot of recommendations for Danubian trail
  - maybe I would try trip to Brno, or other Czech town
  - I really liked Budapest in Hungary, or Nessebar in Bulgaria. Few days riding there....
- When I'll feel really turbo-turbo, I would travel across Italia â€” from Rome to Palermo. It is really long trip, so i
  have no illusions I would make it on first try.
  I was inspired for this trip by guys from Ryan with their series from their two trips &mdash; [YouTube](http://youtu.be/SgSDEhHnWr4?list=PL3916E228FA680D8F), or You can watch it embedded on this page bellow ;)
